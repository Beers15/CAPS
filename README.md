## Summary of Problem Domain

  Create a basic event driven application. This app should simulate a delivery service where vendors ship products using the delivery service and when drivers deliver them, those venders will be notified that their customers received what they purchased.
  
  Phase 1 requirements:

    Setup a system of events and handlers that allows for the following:

    Vendors will be alerted by the system when a package is picked up.

    Drivers, will be notified when there is a package to be delivered.

    Drivers will alert the system when they have picked up a package and it is in transit.

    The system will be alerted when a package has been delivered.

    A vendor will be notified when their package has been delivered.

    App will have Proper CI/CD configuration
